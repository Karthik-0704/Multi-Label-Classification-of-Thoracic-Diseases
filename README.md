# Multi-Label-Classification-of-Thoracic-Diseases

<h2>Objective</h2>
<P>
The objective of this project is to enhance the performance of deep learning models for multi-label classification of chest X-ray images using the ChestX-ray14 dataset, which includes fourteen disease annotations. By introducing additional dense layers and optimizing the choice of optimizers, the aim is to improve the accuracy of disease prediction. Leveraging the powerful convolutional neural network architectures InceptionV3 and ResNet-50, the project focuses on detailed annotations for each image to facilitate a nuanced understanding of thoracic diseases. While the preliminary results show promise in terms of quantitative performance, the challenges in fully automating the interpretation of chest X-rays highlight the need for ongoing refinement of deep learning models to enhance accuracy in computer-aided diagnosis.
